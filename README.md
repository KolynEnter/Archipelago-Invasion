# Archipelago-Invasion
The first swift 🐧 version of my game Archipelago 🏝️ Dramatically changed game play style 💥

Features:
1. Made purely with Swift language (SpriteKit & UIKit), originally built with Java.
2. Support playing style of both landscape and portrait mode on iPhone and iPad
3. Chess-like unit movement and it is a 1v1 game. (You and my AI, for now...)
4. Planned to implement luck-based elements
5. Unlike in Chess, Units have additional space availiability: either melee or ranged
6. Simple skill systems

Todos:
1. A cleaner architecture
2. Lots of testing
3. More levels
4. Add shopping scene, characters, items
